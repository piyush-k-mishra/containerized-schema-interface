# Containerized Schema Curation Interface

We have designed a web application that provides the visualization of well-structured schemas and allows the curator to correct them. The application lets the user upload the schema, and the application returns a graphical representation. These well-structured schemas follows the rules set by DARPA as part of their KAIROS project.
